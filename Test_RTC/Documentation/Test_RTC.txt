Module "RTC1"      (component RTC_LDD)
   - RTC1_Init -Initializes the device. There are two modes of initialization.   1) RTC device is NOT battery backed up. 
                (SoftInit = FALSE)     All registers (interrupts, counters, clock routing …) that influence RTC behavior are 
                initialized.      Note: This initialization mode doesn't preserve time and date settings.   2) RTC device IS 
                battery backed up.     (SoftInit = TRUE). Only registers that are not backed up are initialized (Interrupt 
                priority …). RTC device is running, time and date a preserved, RTC interrupts (events) are preserved too.   
                Allocates memory for the device data structure.   This method can be called only once. Before the second call 
                of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - RTC1_GetEventMask -Returns current events mask. Note: Event that are not generated (See the "Method" tab in the Component 
                inspector) are not handled by this method. Pair method to <SetEventMask>.
   - RTC1_SetEventMask -Enables/disables event(s). The events contained within the mask are enabled. Events not contained 
                within the mask are disabled. The component event masks are defined in the PE_Types.h file. Note: Event that 
                are not generated (See the "Method" tab in the Component inspector) are not handled by this method. In this 
                case the method returns ERR_VALUE error code. Pair method to <GetEventMask>.
   - RTC1_GetTime -Returns actual time and date.    Note: Fields not supported by HW are calculated in software.
   - RTC1_SetTime -Sets new time and date.   Note: All LDD_RTC_TTime structure members must be correctly filled in.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
